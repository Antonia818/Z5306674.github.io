   <h2>CrossNet's System</h2>
 
   <p>CrossNet's system is built on a shared cultural database—first developed by global consultants, technical volunteers, and communities using multilingual data and real communication examples. After the platform went public, the system continued to improve. It observes how users respond to previews, how they adjust their wording, and how messages are understood across cultures. At the same time, volunteers carry out ongoing research based on user feedback and language habits. Together, these efforts help the system stay flexible and accurate as language and culture keep changing.<br>
   CrossNet will combine the records in the database when it is running and analyze the “tone” and “mood” of the users through the content of the postings to summarize the new experience. It does not decide what is right or wrong, but only provides the content that best matches the user's daily cultural habits as a reference.</p>
